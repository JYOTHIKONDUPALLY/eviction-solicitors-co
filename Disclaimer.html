        <h1>Eviction Lawyers Complaints Handling Procedure</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 14px;color: rgb(153, 152, 152);">
            This Complaints Handling Procedure tells you how we will deal with your complaint and how long it is likely
            to take. It also provides important information about what you can do if you are not happy with the way in
            which we are dealing with your complaint, or about our final decision.
        </p>
        <h4>Designated Complaints Handler</h4>
        <p>If you have any concerns about our service, our work, or our charges, you should discuss these first with the
            individual who has day-to-day control of your matter.</p>
        <p>If this person cannot satisfactorily address your concerns and you wish to make a complaint, please contact
            our Designated Complaints Handler, Ashley Leung. </p>
        <p>You can write to him at 85 Great Portland Street,
            First Floor, London, W1W 7LT or send an email to info@evictionlawyers.co.uk.</p>
        <h5>Step One: Acknowledging your Complaint</h5>
        <p>Within two working days of receiving your complaint, your complaint will be recorded in our Complaints
            Register and a separate file will be opened in which we will store any correspondence and other documents
            relating to your complaint. Within two working days we will also send you a letter acknowledging your
            complaint.</p>
        <h5>Step Two: Investigating your Complaint</h5>
        <p>
            Within five working days of receiving your complaint, we will review your file(s) and any other relevant
            documentation and send you a letter telling you how we propose to deal with your complaint. Examples of what
            we might say in this letter are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>If your complaint is straightforward, we might make suggestions as to how we can put things right or we
                may offer you some form of redress;</li>
            <li>If your complaint is more complicated, we might ask you to confirm, explain or clarify any issues;</li>
            <li>We may ask to meet with you to discuss things face-to-face and we would hope to be in a position to meet
                with you no longer than fourteen working days after first receiving your complaint. If you would prefer
                not to meet, or if we cannot arrange this within an agreeable timescale, we will write to you fully
                setting out our views on the situation and making suggestions as to how we can put things right, or
                asking you to confirm, explain or clarify any issues. Within three working days of any meeting, we will
                write to you again to confirm what took place and to confirm any offer of redress that we have made.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whichever form our investigation takes, we will aim to give you our final decision within six weeks of
            receiving your complaint (or sooner if possible).</p>
        </p>
        <h5>Step Three: Appealing against our Final Decision</h5>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with our final decision, please let us know and we will review our decision again.
            We will let you know the result of any appeal within five working days of receiving your appeal.</p>
        <h5>Step Four: The Legal Ombudsman</h5>
        <p>If you are still not satisfied, you can then contact the Legal Ombudsman about your complaint provided you do
            so within six months of the end of our Internal Complaints Handling Procedure.</p>
        <p>In addition, there are time limits relating to the date you first became aware or should have become aware of
            the problem. The relevant time limits are set out in the version of the Legal Ombudsman’s Scheme Rules in
            force from time to time (which can be accessed
            at:https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk/information-centre/corporate-publications/scheme-rules or by contacting
            the Legal Ombudsman using the contact details provided below) and may only be extended by the Legal
            Ombudsman in exceptional circumstances.</p>
        <p>You must take your complaint to the Legal Ombudsman:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Within six months of receiving a final response to your complaint, and
            </li>
            <li>No more than one year from the date of act/omission; or</li>
            <li>No more than one year from when you should reasonably have known there was cause for complaint.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ordinarily, you cannot use the Legal Ombudsman unless you have first attempted to resolve your complaint
            using our internal Complaints Handling procedure, but you will be able to contact the Legal Ombudsman if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The complaint has not been resolved to your satisfaction within eight weeks of first making the
                compliant to us; or</li>
            <li>The Legal Ombudsman determines fair and reasonable circumstances why the Legal Ombudsman should consider
                your complaint sooner, or without you having to use our internal Complaints Handling Procedure first; or
            </li>
            <li>The Legal Ombudsman considers that your complaint cannot be resolved using our internal Complaints
                Handling Procedure because the relationship between you and us has broken down irretrievably.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you wish to make a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman, you must be one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An individual;</li>
            <li>A micro-enterprise as defined in European Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 (broadly, an
                enterprise with fewer than 10 staff and a turnover or balance sheet value not exceeding €2 million);
            </li>
            <li>A charity with an annual income less than £1 million;</li>
            <li>A club, association or society with an annual income less than £1 million;</li>
            <li>A trustee of a trust with a net asset value less than £1 million; or</li>
            <li>A personal representative or the residuary beneficiaries of an estate where a person with a complaint
                died before referring it to the Legal Ombudsman.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are not, you should be aware that you can only obtain redress by using our Complaints Handling
            Procedure or by mediation or arbitration, or by taking action through the Courts.</p>

        <h5>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h5>
        <p>Where we are not able to settle your complaint using our internal complaints process, there are alternative
            complaints bodies (such as the Ombudsman Services www.ombudsman-services.org) which are competent to deal
            with complaints about legal services should both you and our firm wish to use such a scheme.<br></br>

            Please let us know if you would like to consider using an alternative complaints body to resolve your
            complaint.</p>
