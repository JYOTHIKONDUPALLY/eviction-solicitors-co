            immediately outside of our office premises.</p>

        <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>

                other crime.</li>
            <li>For the personal safety of staff, visitors, and other members of the public and to act as a deterrent
                against crime.</li>
            <li>To support law enforcement bodies in the prevention, detection, and prosecution of crime.</li>
            <li>To assist in day-to-day management, including ensuring the health and safety of staff and others.</li>
            <li>To assist in the effective resolution of disputes which arise in the course of disciplinary or grievance
                proceedings.</li>
            <li>To assist in the defence of any civil litigation, including employment tribunal proceedings.</li>
            <li>To assist in effective day-to-day supervision of staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This list is not exhaustive and other purposes may be or become relevant.CCTV recordings are managed by the
            landlord.CCTV recordings are kept for 3 months after which time they are then overwritten with new
            recordings. </p>

        <h5>IF YOU MAKE AN ENQUIRY TO OUR FIRM </h5>
        <p>Where you make an enquiry to our firm but do not instruct us following that enquiry, we will hold details of
            your enquiry on our systems for up to 12 months. This is for our legitimate interests in being able to
            ensure that we can recall your enquiry should you revisit the matter with us some weeks or months later,
            therefore improving your experience with us, and to ensure that we can call upon it if any complaint is made
            about the way that we handled your enquiry. After this time, the record of your enquiry to us, along with
            your personal data that you provided to us, will be permanently deleted from our systems.</p>
        <p>If we seek consent from you to send details of our services that we may think may interest you in the future,
            then we will hold your contact details on our marketing database until you ask us to stop sending such
            materials. Where this is by email, you can unsubscribe from our marketing at any point using the unsubscribe
            facility in each and any marketing email that we send to you. Your details will be removed from our systems
            as soon as possible after receipt of a notification from you that you no longer wish to receive our
            marketing material, and no longer than one month after receipt of your notice.</p>

        <h2>IF YOU ARE A CLIENT </h2>

        <h5>Holding your personal data</h5>
        <p>During the progress of our clients’ matters, we may hold your information both electronically and in paper
            format. We will use all reasonable measures to ensure that your information remains confidential and will
            advise you immediately if we believe that any of your information has been released. We have procedures in
            place with our staff members to ensure that your information is only seen by members of staff who have a
            legitimate reason for accessing your file, such as fee earners and support staff working on your file and
            senior members of the firm for the purposes of supervision, checking your file for quality purposes or to
            deal with any complaints..</p>

        <p>Once our clients’ matters have concluded, we will hold your information on our clients’ files in our archive
            storage (paper files) or archive them on our file management systems (electronic files) for at least 6 years
            from the date that the matter is closed in line with our retention periods. After that period has elapsed,
            we will destroy our clients’ files securely and/or delete it from our electronic records. Once that has

            storage providers to process your personal data to the standards expected in the UK. Our providers are bound
