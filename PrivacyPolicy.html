            <li>Contact you to respond to your request for contact.</li>

            <li>Send information to you about the firm and its services, where you have given us express authority to do
                so.</li>

            consent for us to use your contact details in this way.</p>

        <p>Our lawful basis for using your information in this way will be two-fold:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For our legitimate interests in marketing our services; and</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality monitoring:</strong> to help us to monitor our service levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Training:</strong> to help us to identify training needs and to provide training material from

                our staff.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our legal basis for recording calls is to protect our legitimate interests in ensuring that we have the
            information available for the reasons stated above.</p>

        <br>Call recordings may be disclosed to third parties if required to settle a dispute or report any abusive
        behaviour. Call recordings will also be disclosed to third parties if required by law.</br>

        <br>Call recordings are stored on the VoIP providerâ€™s server.</br>

        <p>All call recordings are kept for 6 months after which time they are permanently destroyed.</p>

        <h5>VISITING OUR OFFICES</h5>
        <p>Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) is in operation at our office premises. CCTV operates only in the spaces
            immediately outside of our office premises.</p>

        <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>We process your data under one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
        <p>The landlord believes that use of CCTV is necessary for our legitimate interests in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preventing crime and protecting our office premises and assets from damage, disruption, vandalism, and
                other crime.</li>
            <li>For the personal safety of staff, visitors, and other members of the public and to act as a deterrent
                against crime.</li>
            <li>To support law enforcement bodies in the prevention, detection, and prosecution of crime.</li>
            <li>To assist in day-to-day management, including ensuring the health and safety of staff and others.</li>
            <li>To assist in the effective resolution of disputes which arise in the course of disciplinary or grievance
                proceedings.</li>
            <li>To assist in the defence of any civil litigation, including employment tribunal proceedings.</li>
            <li>To assist in effective day-to-day supervision of staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This list is not exhaustive and other purposes may be or become relevant.CCTV recordings are managed by the
            landlord.CCTV recordings are kept for 3 months after which time they are then overwritten with new
            recordings. </p>

        <h5>IF YOU MAKE AN ENQUIRY TO OUR FIRM </h5>
        <p>Where you make an enquiry to our firm but do not instruct us following that enquiry, we will hold details of
            your enquiry on our systems for up to 12 months. This is for our legitimate interests in being able to
            ensure that we can recall your enquiry should you revisit the matter with us some weeks or months later,
            therefore improving your experience with us, and to ensure that we can call upon it if any complaint is made
            about the way that we handled your enquiry. After this time, the record of your enquiry to us, along with
            your personal data that you provided to us, will be permanently deleted from our systems.</p>
        <p>If we seek consent from you to send details of our services that we may think may interest you in the future,
            then we will hold your contact details on our marketing database until you ask us to stop sending such
            materials. Where this is by email, you can unsubscribe from our marketing at any point using the unsubscribe
            facility in each and any marketing email that we send to you. Your details will be removed from our systems
            as soon as possible after receipt of a notification from you that you no longer wish to receive our
            marketing material, and no longer than one month after receipt of your notice.</p>
