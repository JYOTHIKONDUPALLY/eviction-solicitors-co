          <h4>Disclaimers Relating to Downloads</h2>
            <p>

              To the extent permitted by law, the Firm excludes all liability in contract, tort (including negligence)
              breach of statutory duty or otherwise for any costs, losses, claims, damages, expenses or proceedings
              (including special, incidental or consequential loss or damage, loss of profits and wasted management
              time) incurred or suffered by you arising directly or indirectly in connection with the use of the
              download facility and the content of any downloaded material including any loss, damage or expense arising
              from, but not limited to, any defect, error, imperfection, fault, mistake or inaccuracy or copyright with
              the downloads, their content or associated services or due to any unavailability of part or all of any
              associated website or associated service.</p>

            <p>The documents available for download are created exclusively by third parties and the Firm excludes all
              liability for any illegality arising from error, omission, inaccuracy or copyright in such material and
              takes no responsibility for such material.</p>

            <p>Any downloads are provided solely for your convenience and the Firm does not necessarily endorse the
              material which can be downloaded and will have no liability to you in respect of the same.</p>

            <p>Downloading documents from the Website should not be used as an alternative to legal advice from a
              qualified solicitor and using any such documents does not create a solicitor-client relationship between
              you and the Firm.</p>

            <p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Website is done at your own
              discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss
              of data that results from the download of any such material.</p>

            <p>The Firm cannot guarantee that downloading documents from the Website will be free from error and/or
              uninterrupted and we shall not be liable for any damages including, but not limited to, indirect or
              consequential damages, damages for loss of opportunity or chance, or any damages whatsoever arising from
              use or loss of use, data, or profits, whether in contract, negligence or other tortious action, arising
              out of, or in connection with the download facility or any associated website.</p>

            <p>Whilst effort has been taken to ensure that any downloads are free from viruses, no warranties are given
              to that effect and users are responsible for ensuring that they have installed adequate virus checking
              software. The Firm shall not be liable for any viruses or any other computer code, files or programs
              designed to interrupt, restrict, destroy, limit the functionality of or compromise the integrity of users’
              computer hardware. All documents are downloaded at the user’s own discretion and risk and the user shall
              be solely responsible for any damage to the user’s computer system or loss of data that results from the
              download of any documents.</p>

            <p>Nothing in the Terms serves to exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury arising from
              negligence or any liability which is otherwise prohibited from being excluded by law.</p>
            <p>We cannot guarantee downloaded files are virus-free. You are responsible for using appropriate antivirus
              protection.</p>

            <h2>Financial Services and Insurance Distribution</h2>
            <h5>Marketing</h5>
            <p>Where the Website or any other of our promotional literature or materials refer to the provision of
              financial services by the Firm (such as our ability to help clients arrange after the event legal expenses
              insurance or title indemnity insurance), such references do not indicate and should not be understood as
              indicating that the Firm is a person to whom the general prohibition does not apply. The general
              prohibition against providing financial services which are regulated activities does apply to the Firm and
              its regulated principals and employees. The Firm is not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority nor
              is it exempt from authorisation under sections 38 – 39A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
            </p>
            <h5>Insurance distribution activity</h5>
            <p>The Firm is not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we are included on the register
              maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority so that we can carry on insurance distribution activity in
              the UK, which is broadly the advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of
              our business, including arrangements for complaints or redress if something goes wrong, is regulated by
              the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The Register can be accessed via the Financial Conduct Authority
              website.</p>
            <h5>Investment transactions</h5>
            <p>The Firm is not authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but we are able in certain
              circumstances to offer a limited range of investment services to clients because we are regulated by the
              Solicitors Regulation Authority. We can provide these investment services if they are an incidental part
              of the professional services we have been engaged to provide. Nothing we say or do should be construed as
              an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activities, nor as advice on the investment merits of
              acquiring or disposing of particular investments.</p>

            <h2>Electronic Commerce (EC) Directive Regulations 2002 and Provision of Services Regulations 2009</h2>
            <p>The following information is provided by us to ensure our compliance with the above regulations:</p>

            <p>The Firm is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (ID Number: 813100) and as
              such is bound by the SRA Standards and Regulations which can be viewed at <a
                href="https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations</a></p>
            <p>We are not VAT registered.</p>
            <p>We hold professional indemnity insurance as required by the SRA; details are available upon request.</p>
            <p>Our internal complaints procedure is available on request, and we cooperate fully with the Legal
              Ombudsman:
              <a href="https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.legalombudsman.org.uk</a>
            </p>

            <h5>Severability</h5>
            <p>If the Terms or any part of them should be determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable
              under the laws of any state or country in which the Terms are intended to be effective, then to the extent
              that they are so illegal, invalid or unenforceable, they shall in that state or country be treated as
              severed and deleted from the Terms and the remaining provisions contained within the Terms shall survive
              and remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable in that state or country.
            </p>

            <h5>Events Beyond Our Control</h5>
            <p>The Firm will not be responsible for any breach of the Terms caused by circumstances beyond its
              reasonable control.</p>

            <h5>Governing Law</h5>
            <p>This legal notice and all issues regarding the Website are governed by English law. Access is granted on
              condition that you accept all of the above and agree to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and
              Wales to settle matters in relation to the Website.</p>
