        available for inspection at our registered office.</p>

      <p>The legal information on the Website is to provide users with the Terms upon which they use the Website and
        to make accessible certain other legal and regulatory information which it is best practice to place in the
        public domain where it can be easily accessed by clients and other interested third parties. The legal
        information on the Website should, for clients of the Firm, be read in association with our client care letter
        and terms of business (the 'Client Care Documents') and other documents referred to in the Client Care
        Documents (such as the conditional fee agreement). The Client Care Documents shall take precedence over any
        legal notice on the Website in the event that they differ from one another.</p>

      <p>The Website is owned and operated by the Firm, which may include any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or
        co-branded businesses.</p>

      <p>Use of the Website is subject to these Terms, which were last updated in <strong>July 2025</strong>. The Firm

        we give no warranty or make any representation regarding the fitness for purpose, continued availability,
        quality, accuracy or completeness of the content of the Website. Accordingly, the materials on the Website do
        not give specific legal advice and should not be relied on as doing so. In particular, you should be aware
        that laws and regulations might be different outside England. Your use of the Website does not create a
        contractual or solicitor-client relationship between you and the Firm. We recommend you contact the advisers
        who are named on the Website for advice about particular matters. The Firm excludes all liability for any kind
        of loss or damage that may result to you or a third party in connection with the use, inability to use, or the
        results of the use of the Website.</p>

        breach of statutory duty or otherwise for any costs, losses, claims, damages, expenses or proceedings
        (including special, incidental or consequential loss or damage, loss of profits and wasted management
        time) incurred or suffered by you arising directly or indirectly in connection with the use of the

      <p>Downloading documents from the Website should not be used as an alternative to legal advice from a

      <p>Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Website is done at your own
        discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss

        consequential damages, damages for loss of opportunity or chance, or any damages whatsoever arising from
        use or loss of use, data, or profits, whether in contract, negligence or other tortious action, arising
        out of, or in connection with the download facility or any associated website.</p>

      <p>Whilst effort has been taken to ensure that any downloads are free from viruses, no warranties are given
        to that effect and users are responsible for ensuring that they have installed adequate virus checking
        software. The Firm shall not be liable for any viruses or any other computer code, files or programs
        designed to interrupt, restrict, destroy, limit the functionality of or compromise the integrity of users'
        computer hardware. All documents are downloaded at the user's own discretion and risk and the user shall
        be solely responsible for any damage to the user's computer system or loss of data that results from the
        download of any documents.</p>

      <p>Nothing in the Terms serves to exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury arising from
        negligence or any liability which is otherwise prohibited from being excluded by law.</p>

      <p>We cannot guarantee downloaded files are virus-free. You are responsible for using appropriate antivirus
        protection.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-3">Financial Services and Insurance Distribution</h2>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Marketing</h5>
      <p>Where the Website or any other of our promotional literature or materials refer to the provision of
        financial services by the Firm (such as our ability to help clients arrange after the event legal expenses
        insurance or title indemnity insurance), such references do not indicate and should not be understood as
        indicating that the Firm is a person to whom the general prohibition does not apply. The general
        prohibition against providing financial services which are regulated activities does apply to the Firm and
        its regulated principals and employees. The Firm is not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority nor
        is it exempt from authorisation under sections 38 – 39A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Insurance distribution activity</h5>
      <p>The Firm is not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we are included on the register
        maintained by the Financial Conduct Authority so that we can carry on insurance distribution activity in
        the UK, which is broadly the advising on, selling and administration of insurance contracts. This part of
        our business, including arrangements for complaints or redress if something goes wrong, is regulated by
        the Solicitors Regulation Authority. The Register can be accessed via the Financial Conduct Authority
        website.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Investment transactions</h5>
      <p>The Firm is not authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 but we are able in certain
        circumstances to offer a limited range of investment services to clients because we are regulated by the
        Solicitors Regulation Authority. We can provide these investment services if they are an incidental part
        of the professional services we have been engaged to provide. Nothing we say or do should be construed as
        an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activities, nor as advice on the investment merits of
        acquiring or disposing of particular investments.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="mb-3">Electronic Commerce (EC) Directive Regulations 2002 and Provision of Services Regulations 2009
      </h2>
      <p>The following information is provided by us to ensure our compliance with the above regulations:</p>

      <p>The Firm is authorised and regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (ID Number: 813100) and as
        such is bound by the SRA Standards and Regulations which can be viewed at <a
          href="https://www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          class="text-decoration-none">www.sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations</a></p>
      <p>We are not VAT registered.</p>
      <p>We hold professional indemnity insurance as required by the SRA; details are available upon request.</p>
      <p>Our internal complaints procedure is available on request, and we cooperate fully with the Legal
        Ombudsman:
        <a href="https://www.legalombudsman.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          class="text-decoration-none">www.legalombudsman.org.uk</a>
      </p>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Severability</h5>
      <p>If the Terms or any part of them should be determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable
        under the laws of any state or country in which the Terms are intended to be effective, then to the extent
        that they are so illegal, invalid or unenforceable, they shall in that state or country be treated as
        severed and deleted from the Terms and the remaining provisions contained within the Terms shall survive
        and remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable in that state or country.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Events Beyond Our Control</h5>
      <p>The Firm will not be responsible for any breach of the Terms caused by circumstances beyond its
        reasonable control.</p>

      <h5 class="mb-3">Governing Law</h5>
      <p>This legal notice and all issues regarding the Website are governed by English law. Access is granted on
        condition that you accept all of the above and agree to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and
        Wales to settle matters in relation to the Website.</p>
